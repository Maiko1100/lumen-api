Dear {{$name}},<br>
<br>
The Dutch tax authorities have imposed a (preliminary) tax assessment. <br>
Please find the report of the tax assessment in the "tax return" section in your client portal. Go to the {{$year}} and under submission you will find the (preliminary) tax assessment<br>
    imposed. The tax assessment is in line with the Dutch tax return filed on your behalf and no further action is required.<br>
<br>
    You can enter the client portal direct via this link.<br>
    If you have any questions, please contact us via e-mail (info@ttmtax.nl) or call us via +31 (0)20 511009.<br>

    Enjoy the day!<br>
